    Clarity processes website content such as images and text temporarily to provide transcription services. This data is sent securely to our backend server at <code>https://clarity-yilz.onrender.com</code> for processing.

  <p>
    Clarity does not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, emails, or account details.

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>
    The data processed (website content) is used solely to generate transcription results and is not used for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing of Data</h2>
  <p>
    Data sent to our backend is not shared with third parties except for the OpenAI API, which processes the transcription requests on our behalf. We do not sell, trade, or rent user data.

    Users can uninstall or disable the extension at any time to stop all data processing. No data is retained after the transcription process completes.
